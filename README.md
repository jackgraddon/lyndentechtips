# Lynden Tech Tips
A collection of YouTube tutorials on technology at Lynden High School

## Details
This project is a collection of video tutorials that cover various technologies used at Lynden High School, such as OneDrive and laptop basics, hosted on YouTube. The channel has amassed over 66k views at the time of writing. This was a solo project, excluding the voices used to narrate the videos, where I went around school and asked people if they wanted to narrate a video. I wrote the scripts, coached the talent, recorded, and edited the videos myself using Final Cut Pro X. The branding was made using Adobe Illustrator.
